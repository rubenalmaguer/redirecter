## Simple redirecter

Used to get around a the url encoding applied by OmegaT to all external searches.

### How to us it
Append desired url to the redirecter's address (`https://forwarder.netlify.app/`) as a query string (preceded by "<span style="color:indianred"><b>?</b></span>").

This will take you to example.com:

`https://forwarder.netlify.app/`<span style="color:indianred"><b>?</b></span>`https://www.example.com`
